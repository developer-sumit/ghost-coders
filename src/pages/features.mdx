## Overview

**"Sansthaein Aur Samvidhan & Institutions & Constitution"** is an innovative digital solution aimed at spreading constitutional literacy among citizens of India. Designed as a gamified platform, the solution simplifies the language of the Constitution of India from the perspective of its three organs: **Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary (Part V & Part VI)**. Our vision is to make constitutional learning accessible, engaging, and inclusive to all citizens, regardless of age, education, or background.

We've considered two alternative names for the app: **"One Law"** and **"ConstiTution"**. Whether or not we're selected for the final round, this project will move forward using one of these names. This documentation serves both the **Judges** and future **Team Members**.
